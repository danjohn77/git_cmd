<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="/exampleapp/main.css" />
The head element of the HTML code of the Notes page contains a link tag, 
which determines that the browser must fetch a CSS style sheet from the 
address main.css.

The <link> HTML element specifies relationships between the current document 
and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets,
but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons 
for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation 
of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, 
MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, 
on paper, in speech, or on other media.

.container {
  padding: 10px;
  border: 1px solid;
}

.notes {
  color: blue;
}

The file defines two class selectors. These are used to select certain 
parts of the page and to define styling rules to style them.
A class selector definition always starts with a period and contains the 
name of the class.
Classes are attributes, which can be added to HTML elements.

The CSS rule defines that elements with the container class will be outlined 
with a one-pixel wide border. It also sets 10-pixel padding on the element. 
This adds some empty space between the element's content and the border.

The second CSS rule sets the text color of the notes class as blue.

HTML elements can also have other attributes apart from classes. The div 
element containing the notes has an id attribute. JavaScript code uses 
the id to find the element.
